# Gas_Pipeline_Monitoring_System

The purpose of gas pipeline leakage detection at hospitals is to ensure
the safety and well-being of patients, staff, and visitors. The detection
systems are designed to promptly identify any gas leaks within the
hospital premises, minimizing the risk of fire, explosions, or other
hazardous incidents. By continuously monitoring the gas pipelines
using advanced sensors and technologies, potential leaks can be
detected in real-time. This enables immediate action to be taken, such
as shutting off the gas supply, evacuating affected areas, and
addressing the issue to prevent any harm. The primary purpose is to
maintain a secure environment within the hospital, protecting the
lives and health of all individuals present.
